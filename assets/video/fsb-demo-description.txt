A short recording of me using the fediverse sharing button, filling out various fediverse domain names, showing how the icon changes to match the software running on each server.

The interface itself consists of an input field for the domain name and a share button preceded by an icon.

An "https" placeholder text is before the input field to signal that this part of the URL is not needed.
